"""
Explanation:
1. **Audit Categories**:
   - The audit criteria are defined across various categories such as data collection, storage, access, and compliance with regulations (e.g., GDPR).
   - Each category has a set of questions that help evaluate the organization's data privacy practices.

2. **Collecting Responses**:
   - The `collect_responses` function asks the user a series of questions based on the predefined audit criteria.
   - The responses must be either "Yes" or "No". If the user provides any other answer, the input is re-asked until a valid response is given.

3. **Analyzing Responses**:
   - The `analyze_responses` function identifies vulnerabilities by looking for 'No' responses, indicating areas where the organization may have weaknesses in its data privacy practices.
   
4. **Generating the Report**:
   - The `generate_report` function generates a JSON file with the audit results, including the timestamp of the audit and a list of identified vulnerabilities.
   - This report is saved to a file with a unique name based on the current timestamp.

5. **Displaying the Summary**:
   - The `display_summary` function provides a quick overview of how many issues were identified in each audit category, along with the specific questions that were answered "No".

6. **Security and Compliance**:
   - This audit checks for basic security measures and compliance with regulations like GDPR, helping organizations ensure their data privacy practices are robust.

Complexity Analysis:
1. **Time Complexity**:
   - The time complexity of collecting responses is O(m * n), where 'm' is the number of categories and 'n' is the number of questions per category.
   - The complexity of analyzing responses and generating the report is O(m * n), as it involves iterating over each question and response.

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - The space complexity is O(m * n), as the responses and vulnerabilities are stored in dictionaries and lists.
   
Note: This is a basic data privacy audit tool. In real-world applications, the audit process would be more extensive, potentially involving automated checks and integration with security systems.
