To configure file names directly in the program, we can set default values for the `username_password_file` and `leaked_passwords_file`. This way, if the user does not provide a file path, the program can default to these predefined file names.

### Modified Program with Default File Names:

```python
def check_leaked_passwords(username_password_file, leaked_passwords_file):
    try:
        # Read the leaked passwords into a set for fast lookup
        with open(leaked_passwords_file, 'r') as file:
            leaked_passwords = set(password.strip() for password in file.readlines())
        
        # Read the username-password file and check for each password
        with open(username_password_file, 'r') as file:
            for line in file:
                username, password = line.strip().split(',')
                
                # Check if the password has been leaked
                if password in leaked_passwords:
                    print(f"Password for {username} has been leaked!")
                else:
                    print(f"Password for {username} is safe.")
    
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("One or both of the files could not be found. Please check the file paths.")

# Default file names
username_password_file = "username_passwords.txt"
leaked_passwords_file = "leaked_passwords.txt"

# Ask user if they want to provide custom file paths
use_custom_files = input("Would you like to provide custom file paths? (y/n): ").strip().lower()

if use_custom_files == 'y':
    username_password_file = input("Enter the file path for the username-password list: ").strip()
    leaked_passwords_file = input("Enter the file path for the leaked passwords list: ").strip()

# Run the program with the configured file paths
check_leaked_passwords(username_password_file, leaked_passwords_file)
```

### How This Works:
1. **Default File Names**:
   - The program defaults to `username_passwords.txt` for the username-password list and `leaked_passwords.txt` for the leaked passwords list.
   
2. **Optional Custom File Paths**:
   - The user is prompted with the option to provide custom file paths. If they choose to enter custom paths, the program will use those paths instead of the default ones.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - If the provided file paths do not exist or cannot be opened, a `FileNotFoundError` is caught, and a message is displayed indicating that the files could not be found.

### Example Input:

**username_passwords.txt**:
```
user1,password123
user2,securepass
user3,qwerty
```

**leaked_passwords.txt**:
```
password123
qwerty
letmein
```

### Sample Output:

If the user opts to use default file paths:

```
Would you like to provide custom file paths? (y/n): n

Password for user1 has been leaked!
Password for user2 is safe.
Password for user3 has been leaked!
```

If the user opts to provide custom file paths:

```
Would you like to provide custom file paths? (y/n): y
Enter the file path for the username-password list: custom_username_passwords.txt
Enter the file path for the leaked passwords list: custom_leaked_passwords.txt

Password for user1 has been leaked!
Password for user2 is safe.
Password for user3 has been leaked!
```

### File Handling:
- **Reading Files**: The program reads the files line by line. It checks for each password against the set of leaked passwords for quick comparison.
- **Error Handling**: If a file is not found or there's an issue reading it, an error message is shown, guiding the user to correct the file paths.

This approach provides flexibility for file name configuration while also ensuring the program handles common errors effectively.
